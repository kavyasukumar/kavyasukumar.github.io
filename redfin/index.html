    <h1>Top 5 least and most affordable large US cities</h1>
<p>In San Francisco at least half of the homes on the market cost more than 13 times the median income making the tech capital the most unaffordable city in the country. But not all big cities are that unaffordable.</p>

<p>We analyzed the latest housing sales data for the top 25 most populated cities in the US to find the most and the least affordable cities.</p>

<h2>Top 5 least affordable large cities</h2>
<p>San Francisco tops the list of least affordable large  cities with half of the 960 homes sold in March, 2018 fetching over $1.4 million. But even with a median household income 80 percent above the national median, not many can afford to buy a house. More than 76 percent of the houses sold over listing price and it is a trend that looks like it is here to stay.</p>

<p>Three other California cities -- San Jose, Los Angeles and San Diego -- along with Miami make the rest of the list.</p>

<h2>Top 5 most affordable large cities</h2>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum are the more affordable cities where a middle-of-the-line house will likely cost the buyer 3-4 times their income. The most affordable of them is Columbus,OH where over half of the houses sold in March, 2018 sold for more than $191,000.</p>

<p>Other cities in the affordable list are Indianapolis,IN, Charlotte, NC, Fort Worth, TX and Detroit, MI.</p>
